    text: `My Dearest Ishi,
  
  If you're reading this, you've discovered my little surprise. I wanted to create something special for you, something that captures even a fraction of what you mean to me.
  
  Every day with you feels like a gift. You make me laugh when I'm down, you inspire me to be better, and you love me in a way I never knew was possible. Your kindness, your strength, your beautiful heart—these are just some of the countless reasons I wake up grateful every single day.
  
  I built this website because sometimes words aren't enough. I wanted to show you, in a way that lasts, just how deeply you've touched my life. Each section here represents a different facet of my love for you—our memories, our journey, the reasons you make my world brighter.
  
  You are my best friend, my partner in adventure, my safe place in the storm. You are the person I want to share every sunrise and sunset with, every victory and challenge, every ordinary Tuesday and extraordinary celebration.
  
  Thank you for being you. Thank you for choosing me. Thank you for making every day feel like Valentine's Day.
  
  I love you more than all the stars in the sky, more than all the grains of sand on every beach, more than words could ever express.
  
  Forever yours,
  Your Valentine ♥
  
  P.S. - Yes, I built this website myself. Yes, it took longer than I'd like to admit. Yes, it was worth every second because you're worth everything to me.`
